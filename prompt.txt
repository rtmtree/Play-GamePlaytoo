run "npm run build" at `js/play_browser` and start http server at "./build"
check if the wasm of WebGPU works at "http://localhost:PORT/?webGPU=opengl" by looking at console if there is error related to WebGPU
if not, fix the C code.
then rebuild with " ./build_wasm_release.sh"

and keep doing this until the "http://localhost:PORT/?webGPU=opengl" log no error (wasm work with WebGPU)


also make sure the app still work with WebGL fallback if WebGPU dies, (should log something like "WebGPU not supported, falling back to WebGL").
if both WebGL and WebGPU fail, better revert.
